Reinventing themselves despite ravages of fire and warfare, challenges to their monopolies and the disappearance of certain trades, today they are revived and thrive with 31 modern companies formed since 1945. Surprisingly 42 Halls have survived or been rebuilt. These historic buildings, the setting for the private life of the Livery, retain commissioned portraits, furniture, silver and stained glass. Rare and curious items reveal the stories behind some of the world’s oldest crafts and guilds which have kept pace with modern times and are still very relevant today.","lecture_image":"/uploads/d0c3cb8c-8ba6-470c-b05f-48bed732c9b6.png"},{"lecture_date":"2022-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","lecture_title":"7.45pm: Ann Benson: Coton Manor, Northamptonshire: A History of its Gardens","lecture_secondary_title":"","lecture_description":"This richly illustrated lecture is based on Ann’s research and tells how Coton Manor and its surrounding designed landscape have developed – and survived ‒ from Domesday to the present.

Within this hierarchy the top dozen, known as ‘the Great XII’ have always had a special prestige. This lecture is told from the inside, as it were.

This man was H.S. ‘Jim’ Ede, curator, writer, collector and friend to artists. In1957, he opened his Cambridge home to university students as “a living place where works of art could be enjoyed… unhampered by the greater austerity of the museum or public art gallery.” His curated home remains, by and large as he left it, characterised by its unique atmosphere, fascinating juxtapositions and personal connections. This lecture will discuss the life of Jim Ede, his collecting, his vision for Kettles Yard and its enduring legacy.","lecture_image":"/uploads/062f729d-98e0-4780-89ac-b81f989d8cfb.jpeg"},{"lecture_date":"2023-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","lecture_title":"7.45pm: Rosalind Whyte: Contemporary Artists: Antony Gormley and Anish Kapoor","lecture_secondary_title":"","lecture_description":"Antony Gormley and Anish Kapoor are amongst the most well-known sculptors working in Britain today and have both had major commissions for public works of art.

Put away the head-phones, take your nose out of the catalogue and discover a strategy for looking at Art. The strategy is a flexible approach to interpreting any piece of art work, giving you the confidence to become an active, rather than a passive, viewer. It is a tool for life: simple and effective. We will put it into practice by looking at a range of works from across the history of Western Art. Your questions and observations will be welcomed and encouraged. This lecture is a must for anyone interested in visiting galleries, exhibitions and art museums. It will, quite simply, help you to ‘see’ more! Learn to trust your own eyes, and enjoy Art to the full.","lecture_image":"/uploads/fcb9cd73-0758-4d04-9a51-e4d752a63189.jpeg"},{"lecture_date":"2023-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","lecture_title":"7.45pm: Caroline Levisse: Seurat’s La Grande Jatte","lecture_secondary_title":"","lecture_description":"From 1884 to 1886 Georges Seurat worked on what became the first Neo-impressionist painting: A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. While working on it, Seurat devised his famous pointillist technique, applying the paint dot by dot, and using colour theory to choose his colours. His aim was to achieve compositions as harmonious and luminous as possible. This stylistic innovation startled the audience and Seurat was soon designated as the leader of a new rebellious school of painting. This lecture focuses on the technical aspect of La Grande Jatte as well as its iconography. Through this analysis we will unveil key aspects of Seurat’s personality, Neo-Impressionism, and the late 19th century Parisian art scene.","lecture_image":"/uploads/2e737f05-b917-4364-a5ca-616e389ebab8.jpeg"},{"lecture_date":"2023-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","lecture_title":"Anniversary Lecture","lecture_secondary_title":"7.45pm: Alan Reid: Godfrey Kneller: Court Painter or Hasty Slobberer?","lecture_description":"Marking his tercentenary, this lecture looks at the life and work of Sir Godfrey Kneller (1646-1723), the leading portraitist of Stuart and early Georgian England.  His ambition was only exceeded by his productivity: there are stories of as many as fourteen sitters in a single day and that at his death, three hundred years ago, there were 500 unfinished portraits in his studio. Such reliance on assistants produced many rather indifferent works and in 1815 James Northcote dismissed the majority of Kneller’s portraits as ‘hasty slobbers…scarcely fit to be seen’. But the sheer volume of work should not taint our opinion of a painter who produced portraits of seven successive British monarchs, the definitive portrait of Isaac Newton, the Kit Kat portraits and the Hampton Court Beauties.  Kneller’s achievement as a painter was actually quite remarkable.","lecture_image":"/uploads/4018831c-7d52-4b1f-af91-39043e197756.jpeg"},{"lecture_date":"2023-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","lecture_title":"7.30pm AGM","lecture_secondary_title":"7.45pm: Chantal Brotherton-Ratcliffe:  Sumptuous Veronese: The Depiction of Luxury Goods in 16th century Venice","lecture_description":"Venice: the Serenissma, but also the Luxurissima. Venice was the port for Europe through which all the glamorous and luxurious products of India, the Middle East and the Far East passed, and she certainly made sure that the best pieces remained in Venice. Indian jewellery, silks and porcelains were given a starring role in the paintings produced by any Venetian artist from the 15th of 16th century -  Bellini and Cima through to the trio of great Venetian artists, Titian Tintoretto and Veronese. But of all of these, it is Veronese who delighted most in depicting the textures and colour effects of luxury goods. This lecture explores how he deployed his luxury props, and what it was in his style of painting that makes them such a feast for the eye.","lecture_image":"/uploads/e2628ec9-7615-4619-8300-d1cbf749a7ed.jpeg"},{"lecture_date":"2023-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","lecture_title":"7.45pm: Nigel Bates: Tantrums and Tiaras","lecture_secondary_title":"","lecture_description":"This lecture is a look at backstage life at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and the pressures faced by performers, be they singer, dancer, conductor or musician.

Cotton was the cause of Russian and then Soviet Colonisation and continues to cause controversy today as well as human misery and environmental catastrophe The felts, carpets, embroideries, robes and veils of the Silk Road stratified wealth, displayed religious and political entrenchments and changed the fortunes of this fascinating part of the world; a meeting place between Mohammed and Marx.","lecture_image":"/uploads/70d4ecb2-4fa9-419c-9a98-fa7ce002bf9d.jpeg"},{"lecture_date":"2023-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","lecture_title":"7.45pm: Hilary Guise: THE OX AND THE ASS, SILENT WATCHERS AT THE CRIB","lecture_secondary_title":"","lecture_description":"Have you ever wondered why every Nativity Christmas card and every school nativity play has to have an Ox and an Ass?   Are they there just to add authenticity to Christ’s lowly birth in a stable?   The mystery deepens when we find they are not mentioned in any of the Gospels, so why are they there?  The whole purpose of Christian art is to tell the Christian stories as vividly and as truthfully as possible for an illiterate world. After all – no one could read.  Yet these animals – the first witnesses to the birth of Jesus – are nowhere to be found in the story. As we explore the Old Testament and look for clues, we go deeper into the Pre-Christian world and find a fascinating history for both the Ox and the Ass.  Themes of ancient sacrifice and Royal power – personifications of Yahweh, and of the most high Pre-Christian deities – parallel the simplicity of the Ass – its symbolic role as a bearer of man’s burdens and even a carrier of Jesus through the fateful gates of Jerusalem. The Ass becomes an early type for Christ as we shall see by interpreting ancient Roman graffiti.  Finally, we can reconcile our findings and arrive at a triad of great significance which we find confirmed on an early Sarcophagus that perfectly illuminates the Christian message – in just three words.  You will discover them at the conclusion of our talk.","lecture_image":"/uploads/806d37ea-4345-4360-b79c-cd6a2be3fbdc.jpeg"},{"lecture_date":"2024-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","lecture_title":"7.45pm: Jeremy Burton: The Queen Mother’s Jewels(The choice isn’t very great, you know)","lecture_secondary_title":"","lecture_description":"Jeremy served as the Queen Mother’s equerry while in the army in the late 1970s.

This inspired him to study gemmology and when he left the Army he qualified as a Fellow of the Gemmological Association of Great Britain. He then spent many years as a jewellery and precious stone dealer in London’s Hatton Garden.

She was the sister of the writer Virginia Woolf, wife of the critic Clive Bell, and counted the painter Roger Fry and the artist Duncan Grant among her lovers.

The dominance of Miss Jekyll and the enduring popularity of gardens at Hidcote and Sissinghurst have proved to be an enduring legacy. There were always subversive undercurrents of alternative styles and influences which, as the new century gets into its stride, have gained a greater importance and momentum. Post-Modernism, rich in symbolism, has, in gardens like Portrack, Little Sparta and Througham Court, explored the worlds of literature and science; while plants, for centuries an abiding passion of English gardeners, have continued to cast their spells, with newly-discovered plants enriching gardens across the country. The New Perennial movement, originating in Europe, has allied itself to our increasing desire to go organic and the interest in woodland and wild-flower meadows to produce a freer, gentler style of painting, spearheaded by Tom Stuart-Smith, perhaps more in tune with the Twenty-First Century.","lecture_image":"/uploads/8bd8de87-31bd-4a03-b707-ea30f5aa72bf.jpeg"},{"lecture_date":"2024-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","lecture_title":"7.45pm: Brian Healey: The Extraordinary Talent of John Singer Sargent","lecture_secondary_title":"","lecture_description":"Few artists can match the achievements of this American artist who trained in Paris and spent much of his life depicting the world of the belle époque, from leisurely days on the Grand Canal, to the society women of New York.

We firstly ask why do we have a National Gallery? The rest of Europe mostly began their National Collections by amalgamating a Royal Collection, but we still have our Royal Collection and so we had to build by other, far less prestigious means.I have chosen 10 paintings that are among my favourites in the collection. Mostly, they are not the well- known favourites. They have stories behind them that are interesting, amusing, unexpected and sometimes surprising. For example a portrait of a female rhinoceros who toured London and set a fashion for having ones hair styled ' a la rhinoceros' - or a portrait of an unknown man who has been sitting on my desk for more than 30 years. Or - in my mind - the most beautiful little angel in the gallery, or a portrait of Paul Cézanne, the gruff, rough Southern Frenchman who was continually surprised that his paintings were even worth framing. I love looking into these pictures and reading their stories.Most of all, it is important to remember that none of these pictures were produced to hang on the walls of a London gallery. - they have
